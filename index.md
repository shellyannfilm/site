AN ANIMATED POST-APOCALYPTIC MUSIC FILM

Coming soon...

Summary:
Bowie is dead. Janis Joplin is long gone and it has been years since Freddie Mercury drew his last breath.

Since then, greedy Moneyman have used pop music and the cultural fastfood lifestyle to turn the world's population into mindless zombies, who walk the scorched earth looking for food and a quick dopamine fix. Civilization has collapsed, the heroes are long gone and all hope is lost.

In this dark, post-apocalyptic world, we meet the young girl Agnea, one of the few people who are still free from the grips of the Moneymen. Her father hasn't returned from his workshop and she fears that he might have been taken by the living dead. 

In a desperate cry for help, she sends a letter to Shelly Ann, a legendary warrior and member of the 27. No one knows if Shelly is still alive or if she has disappered like the rest of the great rockstars, but Agnea has no choice but to believe that she is still out there. 

This is the beginning of an amazing adventure to find Agnea's father and save the world from its grim destiny.
